## Objectives:

The extra-terrestrial menace have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! The collection is too large to search through manually.

Our goal is to show an on-line report which allow user full or partial search on certain fields to spot the information!

## Multiple Search Categories

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`

### Dataset

* [UFO Sightings Data](/static/js/data.js)
